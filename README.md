A collection of personal data visualization, data science, and machine learning projects

## About Me

I'm an engineer with a master's degree in applied mathematics and am currently pursuing certificates in Data Science 
and Machine Learning. I wanted to have a place to share some of the projects I've created while learning and exploring
topics in these fields.

**MontyHall_Simulation.pdf**

This project was a part of the second quarter of my Data Science certificate program. It simulates the famous "Monty Hall" problem, originally featured on the television game show program "Let's Make a Deal". In the game, a contestant is told that a prize exists behind one of three doors, and behind the other two doors are goats. The contestant picks a door, and one of the other two doors is then opened by the host revealing one of the goats. At this point, the contestant is allowed to switch their choice to the remaining door, or stick with their original choice. The optimal strategy is somewhat counterintuitive without evidence, so the writeup performs a simulation to determine the probability of winning the prize for each strategy (switching vs. staying) and summarizes the results.
